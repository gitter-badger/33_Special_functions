\begin{document}
The \emph{error function} ${\rm erf} \colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ is defined as follows:
 $${\rm erf} (z) = {2 \over \sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^z e^{-t^2} \, dt$$
The \emph{complementary error function} ${\rm erfc} \colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ is defined as
 $${\rm erfc} (z) = {2 \over \sqrt{\pi}} \int_z^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt$$

The name ``error function'' comes from the role that these functions play in the theory of the normal random variable.  It is also worth noting that the error function is a special case of the confluent hypergeometric functions and of the Mittag-Leffler function.

\textbf{Note.}\,  By \PMlinkname{Cauchy integral theorem}{SecondFormOfCauchyIntegralTheorem}, the choice path of integration in the definition of ${\rm erf}$ is irrelevant since the integrand is an entire function.   In the definition of ${\rm erfc}$, the path may be taken to be a half-line parallel to the positive real axis with endpoint $z$.
