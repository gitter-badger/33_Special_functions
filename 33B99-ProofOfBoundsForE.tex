Multiplying and dividing, we have
\[ \left( 1 + {1 \over n} \right)^n = \left( 1 + {1 \over m} \right)^m
\prod_{k=m+1}^n { \left( 1 + {1 \over k} \right)^k \over \left( 1 + {1
\over k-1} \right)^{k-1}} \]
As was shown in the parent entry, the quotients in the product can
be simplified to give
\[ \left( 1 + {1 \over n} \right)^n = \left( 1 + {1 \over m} \right)^m
\prod_{k=m+1}^n \left( 1 - {1 \over k^2} \right)^k \left( 1 + {1 \over
k-1} \right) \]
By the inequality for differences of powers,
\[ \left( 1 - {1 \over k^2} \right)^k < 1 - {k \over k^2 + k - 1} 
= {(k+1) (k-1) \over k^2 + k - 1} \]
Hence, we have the following upper bound:
\[ \left( 1 + {1 \over n} \right)^n < \left( 1 + {1 \over m} \right)^m
\prod_{k=m+1}^n {k^2 + k \over k^2 + k - 1} \]
By cross mutliplying, it is easy to see that
\[ {k^2 + k \over k^2 + k - 1} \le {k^2 \over k^2 - 1} \]
and, hence,
\[ \left( 1 + {1 \over n} \right)^n < \left( 1 + {1 \over m} \right)^m
\prod_{k=m+1}^n {k^2 \over k^2 - 1}. \]
Factoring the rational function in the product, terms cancel and we
have
\[ \prod_{k=m+1}^n {k^2 \over (k+1)(k-1)} = {n (m+1) \over (n+1)  m}
= {n \over n+1} \left( 1 + {1 \over m} \right) \]
Combining,
\[ \left( 1 + {1 \over n} \right)^n < {n \over n+1} \left( 1
+ {1 \over m} \right)^{m+1} \]
