The hypergeometric function satisfies several equations which
relate derivatives with respect to the argument $z$ to
shifting the parameters $a, b, c, d$ by unity (Here, the
prime denotes derivative with respect to $z$.):
\begin{align*}
z F' (a, b; c; z) + a F (a, b; c; z) &= F (a+1, b; c; z) \\
z F' (a, b; c; z) + b F (a, b; c; z) &= F (a, b+1; c; z) \\
z F' (a, b; c; z) + (c-1) F (a, b; c; z) &= F (a, b; c-1; z) \\
(1 - z) z F' (a, b; c; z) &= (c - a) F (a-1, b; c; z) + (a - c + bz) F (a, b; c; z) \\
(1 - z) z F' (a, b; c; z) &= (c - b) F (a, b-1; c; z) + (b - c + az) F (a, b; c; z) \\
(1 - z) z F' (a, b; c; z) &= z (c - a) (c - b) F (a, b; c+1; z) +
zc (a + b - c) F (a, b; c; z)
\end{align*}
These equations may readily be verified by differentiating the series
which defines the hypergeometric equation.  By eliminating the derivatives
between these equations, one obtains the contiguity relations for the 
hypergeometric function.  By differentiating them once more and taking
suitable linear combinations, one may obtain the differential equation
of the hypergeometric function.
